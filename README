§1. Summary

Slickdoc is a simple, human-parseable text file format for code documentation,
tailored to ANSI C. It uses ASCII symbols and Compose key symbols in a
context-free grammar that is parseable by both computers and human beings.

grammar.txt describes the syntax for metafiles that group the documentation
together for reading. schema.txt describes the file-folder structure of the
documentation itself.
